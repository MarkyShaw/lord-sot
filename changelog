Extract the repeated logic into a helper function.

Use a dictionary or named structure to map events with names or descriptions, making it easier to manage and extend.

Add type hints for better clarity.

Add an explicit exit option or a win condition.

Values like 100 for health, 5-20 for gold, and 5-15 for healing are hardcoded, making it harder to tweak game balance.
Now define these values as constants.

Add validation for user inputs to avoid unintended behavior.

The time.sleep(1) in the battle function can make debugging or playing slower.
Now it optional or configurable.

Simplify the logic by removing unnecessary checks.

Add periodic summaries or goals.
